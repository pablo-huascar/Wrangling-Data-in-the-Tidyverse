# Wrangling Data in the Tidyverse Course Project
This assignment is part of the "Wrangling Data in the Tidyverse" course from Coursera.

This assignment uses data from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the United States (US). In this project, you will practice data exploration and data wrangling with the tidyverse R packages using this data. 

The CFPB is an independent agency of the United States government that promotes transparency and protects consumers by providing information needed to make decisions when choosing financial institutions including banking institutions, lenders, mortgage services, credit unions, securities firms, foreclosure services, and debt collectors. One of the purposes of the agency is to receive and process complaints and questions about consumer financial products and services.

In this assignment, we will be using the Consumer Complaint Database. You can quickly view, sort and filter the data in your browser. In particular, we will be using data from October 15, 2017 to October 15, 2020.
